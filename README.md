Collection of utilities for the AYN Odin 2. This is a release repo as the app is currently closed source until I clean it up a bit more :)

### Features
- Quick settings tile for switching the controller style with user selectable option for which styles to cycle through
- Quick settings tile for switching the L2/R2 style with user selectable option for which styles to cycle through
- Single press home button setting to allow going to the home screen by a single press of the home button

### Compatibility
This app has been tested with the Odin 2 firmware version **1.0.0.208**. It's possible that AYN breaks the methods used by this app in a future update. The app will warn you accordingly if that's the case.
