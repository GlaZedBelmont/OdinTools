# OdinTools
Collection of utilities for the AYN Odin 2. This is a release repo as the app is currently closed source until I clean it up a bit more :)

Latest release: **[0.3.0](https://github.com/langerhans/OdinTools/releases/latest)**

### Features
- Quick settings tile for switching the controller style with user selectable option for which styles to cycle through
- Quick settings tile for switching the L2/R2 style with user selectable option for which styles to cycle through
- Single press home button setting to allow going to the home screen by a single press of the home button
- Display saturation setting. This is set immediately and will be applied after a reboot as well. Note that it takes a few seconds after you first unlock the device to apply.

### Contact
If you have any questions, feel free to find me on the AYN Discord at https://discord.com/invite/pWCpvEUTdR

### Compatibility
This app has been tested with the Odin 2 firmware version **1.0.0.208**. It's possible that AYN breaks the methods used by this app in a future update. The app will warn you accordingly if that's the case.
